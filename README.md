# IseaOptimizer-Archive
This github is about the obsolete optimizer I created. it has no more updates but I upload it to github.




# History:
The Optimizer I created it based on a youtuber who made optimizers (and still does) called xRelax or something like that.... 

The point is that I installed AutoPlay Studio 8... Which the whole program was made in AutoPlay...

# IseaOptimizer

I made buttons and grabbed regedits, made them with a background and called it: IseaOptimizer... 

The name came from my normal user, IseaCraftYT, which comes from my last name and favorite game, Minecraft, and YT because I wanted them to know I was a youtuber (in the end it didn't help).

# IseaOptimizerV1.0

I made the beta, progressed by adding things, made the first version, IseaOptimizerV1.0.

In that version I was comfortable, but it was missing things...

# IseaOptimizerV1.5

So after improving I made the last version, IseaOptimizerV1.5 which has changes by adding menus, new options, discord, buttons improvement, ect...

For a long time I left it, and it wasn't until I saw a video talking about the program...

So I wanted to port it to github. So here it is....

# End

Well, it's the end... Above are the files, if you want to check them out and maybe use the program.
